Hereâ€™s how the EM method is applied in the code:

Initialization (Expectation Step):

The initial missing values are filled with estimates (e.g., mean or median of the feature).
Imputation (Maximization Step):

For each feature with missing values, the IterativeImputer fits a regression model using the other features.
Missing values are then predicted (imputed) using this model.
Iteration:

The process is repeated iteratively, using the newly imputed values to update the models until convergence or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

To reference the code:
By using IterativeImputer, the code leverages the EM method to handle missing data, ensuring a more robust and statistically sound imputation process compared to simpler methods like mean or median imputation.
